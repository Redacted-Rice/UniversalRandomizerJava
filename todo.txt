A list of things to do in no particular order:
- Begin integrating with PTCGR and ensure use cases are covered
- Make it so it can abort if a module fails or have some dependcies structure to say what requires what or what needs to be run before hand?
- Revisit sandbox. Maybe add resource limits. Check for holes and see if I can relax the includes some
- Add some metadata to modules about who created it and maybe a link or something like that to allow giving credit where its due
- Consider adding grouping/filtering logic of modules in here instead of PTCGR
- Add a way to allow testing/validating modules without a full run?
- Consolidate resource copying scripts and make it auto extract whole folder instead of specifying each file
- Replace configs in context with args for scripts so they are more like modules?

Coding cleanliness tasks
- Separate out pre/post scripts to a separate class other than module
- Look into null annotations
- get gradle sonarlint working. I know some functions are too complex ATM and I'm sure there are other issues

Some finalizing things once I'm confident things won't change much:
- Add more ut & functional test coverage
- Comment code and functions now that things seem more stable and get gradle doxygen working
- Work on readme and make it more comprehesive

Next changes:
- Make it so you can actually run modules twice with different args. Right now its keyed on name which won't work
