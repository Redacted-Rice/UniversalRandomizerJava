A list of things to do in no particular order:
- Begin integrating with PTCGR and ensure use cases are covered
- Revisit sandbox. Maybe add resource limits. Check for holes and see if I can relax the includes some
- Consider adding grouping/filtering logic of modules in here instead of PTCGR
- Figure out if I want to make scripts more or less aligned with modules
  - Replace configs in context with args for scripts so they are more like modules?
  - Would they use seeds? They shouldn't but how do we handle this 
  - Make modules when = "user" and have explicit pre/post field or have the pre/post field include the user equvalent?
  - Separate execution request/results classes?
- Include randomizer in modules by default? Any other things to just always have or do?

Coding cleanliness tasks
- Look into null annotations
- get gradle sonarlint working. I know some functions are too complex ATM and I'm sure there are other issues

Some finalizing things once I'm confident things won't change much:
- Add more ut & functional test coverage
- Comment code and functions now that things seem more stable and get gradle doxygen working
- Work on readme and make it more comprehesive

Potential things:
- Make it so it can abort if a module fails or have some dependcies structure to say what requires what or what needs to be run before hand?
- Add a way to allow testing/validating modules without a full run?
