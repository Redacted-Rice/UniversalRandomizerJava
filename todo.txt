A list of things to do in no particular order:
- Begin integrating with PTCGR and ensure use cases are covered
- get gradle sonarlint working. I know some functions are too complex ATM and I'm sure there are other issues
- Make it so it can abort if a module fails or have some dependcies structure to say what requires what or what needs to be run before hand?
- Revisit sandbox. Maybe add resource limits. Check for holes and see if I can relax the includes some
- Add some metadata to modules about who created it and maybe a link or something like that to allow giving credit where its due
- Maybe allow some file based configuration? Probably not because I want to encourage using the args
- Consider adding grouping/filtering logic in here instead of PTCGR
- Look into null annotations
- Add a way to allow testing/validating modules without a full run?

Some finalizing things once I'm confident things won't change much:
- Add more ut & functional test coverage
- Comment code and functions now that things seem more stable and get gradle doxygen working
- Work on readme and make it more comprehesive
